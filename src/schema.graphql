# An in-game action.  Every action should be replayable, because
#             multiple nodes in a network should execute an action and get the same
#             result.
#             A “class” which implements this interface is
#             analogous to a function, and its instance is analogous to a
#             partial
#             function application, in other words, a function with some bound
#             arguments.  Those parameters that will be bound at runtime should be
#             represented as fields or properties in an action class, and bound
#             argument values to these parameters should be received through
#             a constructor parameters of that class.From a perspective of security, an action class belongs to
#             the network protocol, and property values in an action belong to
#             a node's will (i.e., a user/player's choice).
#             That means if you define an action class it also defines what every
#             honest node can do in the network.  Even if a malicious node changes
#             their own action code it won't affect other honest nodes in
#             the network.For example, where honest nodes share the common action
#             Heal(Target) => PreviousStates[Target] + 1, suppose a malicious
#             node m changes their own Heal action code to
#             Heal(Target) => PreviousStates[Target] + 2 (2 instead of 1),
#             and then send an action Heal(m).
#             Fortunately, this action does not work as m's intention,
#             because the changed code in itself is not used by other honest nodes,
#             so they still increase only 1, not 2.  The effect of that double healing
#             is a sort of “illusion” only visible to the malicious node
#             alone.In conclusion, action code is a part of the protocol and it works with
#             consensus in the network, so only things each node can affect the network
#             in general is property values of each action they sign and send,
#             not code of an action.
